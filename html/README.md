I've used
- w3's responsive header with some adjustments (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_header.asp)
- https://shenanigans.shoghisimon.ca/collection/css-blur-blob-bg/ with some adjustments
- GTNH icons, as this project is for monitoring GTNH, when linking to GTNH itself!

I/We don't claim any copyright or licensing on these parts or modifications, as they are so minor value adjustments, and thereby all copyright and licensing terms belong to the original authors.
In case of issues, please do so here at this repository under https://github.com/Sanduhr32/NewDashHorizons/issues/new .
